# 🫁 Multi-class COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-ray Images

A deep learning–based medical imaging project that classifies chest X-ray images into **COVID-19**, **Viral Pneumonia**, and **Normal** categories.  
The project uses **transfer learning**, **Grad-CAM explainability**, and a **Streamlit web app** for real-time inference.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.  
This project aims to build a **multi-class image classification model** that distinguishes between:
- COVID-19
- Viral Pneumonia
- Normal chest X-rays
